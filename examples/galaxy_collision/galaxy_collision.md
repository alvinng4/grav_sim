In this example, we will simulate the collision of two galaxies with 60000 particles using the initial
conditions from Gadget-2[@gadget2]. The initial conditions is preprocessed into a
HDF5 file and is included in the repository.

To deal with the large number of particles, we used the Barnes-Hut algorithm to
compute the gravitational force. On Macbook Air M1, the simulation can be done
in 5 minutes for $\theta = 1.0$ and 30 minutes for $\theta = 0.5$.

## Gallery
The visualization is done with gadgetviewer, which is compatible with our
HDF5 output format.

## Running the example (C)
To build the example, run
```
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_HDF5=ON -DUSE_OPENMP=ON --fresh
cmake --build build
```
Then, you can run it by
```
cd build
./galaxy_collision
```

## Running the example (Python)


## Animating with gadgetviewer
To use gadgetviewer, you may download the latest release on their GitHub page. For version 1.2.0 and assuming you are on Linux / MacOS, install the dependencies by
```
sudo apt install build-essential gfortran libhdf5-dev libgtk-3-dev
```
Then, run
```
cd <path of gadgetviewer>
./configure --prefix=<path of gadgetviewer>
make
make install
```
Now, you can run gadgetviewer by
```
cd bin
./gadgetviewer
```
For example,
```
./gadgetviewer ../../grav_sim/examples/galaxy_collision/c/build/snapshots/snapshot_00000.hdf5
```
