This is a series of tutorials inspired by the course "CFD Python: 12 steps to Navier-Stokes".
The goal is to teach beginners how to write fast and clean N-body gravity simulations code in Python.

Although basic knowledge in Python is assumed, everything is explained in detail so 
beginners should be able to follow along. Advanced topics would be introduced but they
can be skipped if it is too difficult for the reader.
